# âš¡ IoT-Driven Cyber-Physical Digital Twin (CPDT) for Real-Time Bus Fault Protection in a 3-Bus IEEE Power System  

This project showcases a cutting-edge implementation of **Real-Time Fault Detection and Protection** using an **IoT-enabled Cyber-Physical Digital Twin (CPDT)** framework. By integrating **Raspberry Pi** controllers, **MATLAB Simulink**, and the **ThingSpeak** IoT platform, the system provides a scalable and cost-effective solution to enhance the resilience of power systems.  

In modern smart grids, traditional fault detection methods often struggle to manage the complexities introduced by **renewable energy integration** and **bidirectional power flow**. Static protection mechanisms lack the adaptability required for reliable fault detection and isolation. To address these challenges, this project leverages an **IoT-driven CPDT framework** that accurately detects, isolates, and visualizes faults in real time within a simulated **3-bus IEEE power system**.  

The proposed **Cyber-Physical Digital Twin (CPDT)** ensures real-time monitoring and fault analysis by continuous data acquisition through **Raspberry Pi** controllers and remote monitoring via **ThingSpeak** enables a rapid fault detection response time of **15 seconds**.  

This solution not only enhances operational resilience but also provides a scalable model for future smart grids, ensuring faster fault diagnosis and minimizing system downtime. The project's implementation demonstrates the potential of CPDT in ensuring grid reliability and adaptability in complex energy landscapes.
